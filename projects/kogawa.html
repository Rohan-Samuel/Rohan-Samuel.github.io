                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>In collaboration with the Vancouver City Poems Contest, this film shows about the experience of a
                        6 year old Joy Kogawa at the time of internment. We shot scenes at the Historic Joy Kogawa House
                        (preserved as it was back then), and Hastings Park Vancouver where a lot of the evacuated
                        families were sent and those buildings are still used. </p>
                    <h4>Contributions</h4>
                    <p>I led a team of 3 for this project. I did most of the planning, pre-production, filming, editing
                        and sound design. It was also interesting to plan shoot days with the Joy Kogawa House
                        coordinator who gave us access to the house. </p>

                        <p>It was a great experience working with the Historic Joy Kogawa House which looks exactly like
                            it did when the Kogawas lived there. It was restored and is preserved by this community and
                            also houses events and authors which are inspired by Joy Kogawa's life.</p>
